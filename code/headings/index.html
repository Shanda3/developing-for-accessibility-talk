    <main>
      <h1>H1 - Let's Learn About Headings</h1>
      <p>The above H1 should be your main title; only have one of these.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>H2 - The start of a section</h2>
        <p>Notice how the headings go down in logical order?</p>

        <h3>H3 - A sub-section of the above section</h3>
        <p>
          You def wouldn't want to jump to an H5 after this, for example. But you
          can use the same-level headings just fine.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>H3 - Another sub-section of the same section</h3>
        <p>
          If you want a different sized heading but you're still in the flow of
          the same content, that's okay; that's what CSS is for. Changing font
          size via CSS won't affect accessibility.
        </p>
        <h4>H4 - A sub-header of the above sub-section!</h4>
        <p>
          See! That's a bigger header than the h3, but it's still an h4!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>H2 - The start of an entirely new section</h2>
        <p>When you're done with the previous segment of content, it is okay to
          jump back UP in your heading tags.</p>
      </section>
    </main>
    <aside>
      <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> It might be helpful to think about things like a bulleted list. You
        can go down only one indentation at a time, but you can jump back to any
        level whenever you need to (assuming you're done with that section).
