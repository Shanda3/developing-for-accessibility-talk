# Developing for Accessibility - Talk
By [Aaron Krauss](https://thecodeboss.dev)

This talk was given at
[ThunderPlains Conf 2022](https://www.thunderplainsconf.com/). YouTube link TBD.

## Elevator Pitch

It’s 2022, and we know that your website needs to function properly for all
users - regardless of their capabilities (or else, you know, you could get sued). So
how do we do that, when users have such a range of physical and
cognitive comfort? That’s what this talk is here for.

## Talk Description
In this talk, we’ll be talking about prioritizing accessibility when developing
for the web. Despite what we envision, not every user is 100% comfortable as
far as mental and physical capabilities go – and there’s no excuse for ignoring
that. Building an accessible product almost always leads to a much more
well-architected product – so it’s a win-win.

We’ll cover the tools and strategies you can use to aid users with visual,
auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. We’ll discuss contrast, colors,
content, keyboard flows, screen readers, section 508 – as well as skip menus,
the accessibility tree, hover and focus indicators, ARIA properties, and more.

There’s a lot that developers and designers can do to aid users with
impairments – so let’s do it!

## Installation

All you need to run this is some sort of web server. The instructions in the
`How to Run` section below use an executable file that depends on Python, but if
you don't have Python installed, then you can substitute that command with your
own simple web server.

## Run the Presentation

```shell
./sent presentation.txt
```

tool.

## Run the Code

```shell
cd code

./server
```
Now navigate to http://localhost:8000
