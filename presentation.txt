So what are we
going to talk about?

Developing for Accessibility

What is Accessibility?

a11y

Accessibility is giving a frick about people

All people

That includes users with disabilities

And also users with no disabilities at all

Main Concept

Building an accessible web site
makes your website better overall

* Better design architecture
* Better code architecture
* More quality content
* Better SEO
* More usage (and thus popularity)

And all of that usually means more $$$

Developing an accessibile site
may also be required

Section 508

Some housekeeping...

Don't say "disabled users"

Say "users with disabilities"

Myth Busing Time

Myth #1

Accessibility = handling blind users

Wrong

Accessibility = handling everyone

Myth #2

Accessibility = people use screen readers,
so add image alt text

Wrong

Accessibility = a ton of stuff

But it's okay...

Types of Disabilities

* Visual
* Auditory
* Motor
* Cognitive

Followed by a bonus disability

Visual Concerns

* Screen readers
* Color-blindness
* Contrast
* Z-Pattern
* Open Graph

Screen readers

Windows - JAWS
MacOS - Voice Over (built-in)

Accessibility tree

@images/accessibility-tree.png

Accessibility tree vs DOM tree

Tips for maximizing screen reader usage:

* Use Semantic HTML
  * Such as <section>,<article>,
    <aside>,<nav>, etc.

* Image alt tags

* Using links & buttons right

* ARIA properties

Accessible Rich
Internet Applications

DEMO

Color-blindness

NoCoffee Chrome Plugin

Contrast

Z-Pattern

Users donâ€™t read web pages,
they scan.

Open Graph

Auditory Concerns

For Media:

* Subtitles
* Volume controls
* Ideally default to a "muted" state

For supplemental audio:

* Visual cues
* Nothing absurd (i.e. loud, lengthy, confusing)

Motor Concerns

* Responsive Applications
* Skip menus
* Tab flow
* Focus indicators
* "Submit" actions
* "Cancel" actions

Responsive Applications

@images/responsive.png

Skip menus

Tab flow

Focus indicators

"Submit" actions

e.g. the Enter or Spacebar key

@images/modal.png

"Cancel" actions

e.g. the ESC key

DEMO

Cognitive Concerns

* Good content
* Well-thought-out workflows
* "Panic" mode

Good Content

* Labels
* Titles / Headings
* Call to Actions

Well thought-out workflows

* Analyze multiple users' perspectives
* Build wireframes (and give them to the dev)

"Panic" mode

Think websites like:
* Hospitals
* Schools
* Local News / Weather

Make a few things incredibly simple

Bonus Disability

Drum Roll...

"Data" Disability

Not all users have a ton of data,
let alone fast connections

Especially in other countries

So what can you do?

* Optimize your images

@images/super-mario.png

* 150-200 KB is usually my limit.
Ideally less than that.

* Minify & Tree-shake your CSS and JS

* Don't overdo it on custom fonts

* Set caching HTTP headers
